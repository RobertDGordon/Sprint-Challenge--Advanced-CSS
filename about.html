        <p>We like-a the space.  So much room for activities! The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round, like a spicy meatball!</p>

            <h3>You talkin' to me?</h3>
    
            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet. The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. </p>

                <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it. The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended.</p>

                    <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone.</p>
